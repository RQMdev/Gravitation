## Gravitation
I'm developing a video-game playable in web browsers on all kind of devices, desktops, tablets and smartphones.
Gameplay-wise, it's about controlling a spaceship in a 2D environment. The ship suffers from **Gravity**. The player is able to rotate the spaceship, to thrust it forward and to fire weapons.

There will be different game modes. An **Adventure** mode, playable offline in **Solo** telling the story of a lost spaceship trying to find its way back to civilization. The other Solo mode is a **Race** against the clock in levels varying from the Adventure mode.

Other game modes are **Multiplayer** modes. There is two groups of multiplayer modes, the one versus one mode is called **Duel** and the 1 to 4 player mode is called **Arena**. In both of them, you can play some **Race** in the same levels as the Solo mode Race or you can **Battle** in some new levels where the goals is only to kill your opponent(s).

Apart from the game itself, the user can create an account where he'll be able to configure the key mapping, retrieve is progression, add friends, invite them in a lobby and see is own **Ranking** in the world ladder.
