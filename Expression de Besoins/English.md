## Gravitation
I'm developing a video-game playable in web browsers on all kind of devices, desktops, tablets and smartphones.
Gameplay-wise, it's about controlling a spaceship in a 2D environment. The ship suffers from **Gravity**. The player is able to rotate the spaceship, to thrust it forward and to fire weapons.

There will be different game modes. An **Adventure** mode, playable offline in **Solo** telling the story of a lost spaceship trying to find its way back to civilization. The other Solo mode is a **Race** against the clock in levels varying from the Adventure mode.

Other game modes are **Multiplayer** modes.
